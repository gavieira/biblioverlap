Description: Identifies and visualizes document overlap in any number of bibliographic datasets.
    This package implements the identification of overlapping documents overlap through the exact match of a unique 
    identifier (e.g. Digital Object Identifier - DOI) and, for records where the identifier is absent, through a score calculated from a set of
    fields commonly found in bibliographic datasets (Title, Source, Authors and Publication Year). 
    Additionally, it provides functions to visualize the results of the document matching through a Venn diagram 
    and/or UpSet plot, as well as a summary of the matching procedure.
